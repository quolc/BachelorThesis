Watermarks in a media file can be removed by simply applying a band elimination filter for each of the sub-carrier frequencies.
To minimize the effect on hearing impression of content by watermark deletion, it is desirable to apply BEF only to the regions that contain watermarks.
We implemented a watermark deletion program that detects watermarks in content using the method mentioned above and applies BEF only to necessary regions.
